# Calculation of dropletsâ€™ size distribution after breaking up during mixing liquid-liquid system

During the worh with SPCPU researcher Cand. Sc. (Engineering) (Ph.D. in Technical Science) Ganin P.G. the task was devined to calculate evolution of droplets' size distiribution during mixing

**Input data**: parameters of distiripution: amounts of points to calculation, dissipation, minimal and maximal size of droplets, number of iterations  
**Output data**: distribution of droplets' size after n iteration

**Solution course**:  
The class Distribution that represents the mathematical model of real distribution was created. Class instance contains all characteristics of model and has general methods to calculate the evolution of distribution
